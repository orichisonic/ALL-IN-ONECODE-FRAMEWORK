<h1>Working with Direct2D</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2 come with a lot of cool new features. One of 
the most exciting new features is a new graphic API powered by DirectX. It 
allows you to take advantage of graphic cards to render complex scenarios. It 
includes 3 components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Direct2D: API for drawing vector graphics.</li>
	<li>DirectWrite: API for text rendering.</li>
	<li>WIC (Windows Imaging Component): API for bitmaps encoding and decoding. 
	This API has been around since Windows Vista.</li>
</ul>
<p>Direct2D and DirectWrite will be ported to Vista in the future. But in 
the meanwhile, you need Windows 7 in order to experience the power brought by 
the new graphic engine.</p>
<p>Among all the three components, Direct2D is the most important. You need to 
use Direct2D to render text and bitmap. DirectWrite and WIC do not touch 
rendering on themselves. Also, only WIC relies on COM runtime. Direct2D and 
DirectWrite can work without COM runtime. This sample focuses on Direct2D. We 
will demonstrate other components in the future.</p>
<p>The main target audiences of the new graphic API are native application 
developers. So this sample is written in native code. However, if you are from 
managed backaground, this document also serves to compare some features in WPF 
to Direct2D.</p>
<p>This sample provides an overview of the new vector graphic API. It renders a 
simple scene with a star (or sun) and a planet (or earth). When you click the 
planet, it will move around the star.</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot.PNG" /></p>
<p>The sample demostrates the 
following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Draw simple vector graphics (such as ellipse).</li>
	<li>Draw complex paths.</li>
	<li>Create a PowerShell script to translate XAML path data to C++ Direct2D 
	code.</li>
	<li>Create solid color and radial gradient brushes.</li>
	<li>Simple render transform.</li>
	<li>Perform hit test.</li>
	<li>Control z-index.</li>
	<li>Clip path.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, please refer to the 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd370990(VS.85).aspx">MSDN documents</a> and the Windows SDK 
samples.</p>
<h2>Prepare the project</h2>
<p>To work with Direct2D, you must first import thed2d1.lib library into your Win32 project (specified in Visual C++&#39;s &quot;Project Property 
Pages&quot; =&gt; &quot;Linker&quot; =&gt; &quot;Input&quot; =&gt; &quot;Additional Dependencies&quot;):</p>
<p>Assume you&#39;re working with a standard Win32 project, please also add the 
d2d1.h header files to your stdafx.h:</p>
<p>Still in stdafx.h, let&#39;s write a standard SafeRelease function, which serves 
to release resources in a safe way. You can find this function in many SDK 
samples. Please refer to the SafeRelease function in the sample&#39;s stdafx.h file 
for the code.</p>
<h2>Essential steps to work with Direct2D</h2>
<p>To work with Direct 2D, the following steps are required:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create a factory.</li>
	<li>Create a render target. The render target represents the actual divide. 
	It can be a simple hwnd (as demonstrate in this sample), a Direct3D device 
	(DXGI), or anything else.</li>
	<li>Create other resources, such as brushes.</li>
	<li>Handle the WM_PAINT message, and render the scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>To render the scene, the following steps are required:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Call BeginDraw to initializing the scene.</li>
	<li>Set the transform matrix for the next graph.</li>
	<li>Prepare the graph, if necessary. For example, create a bounding 
	rectangle for text.</li>
	<li>Call various drawing functions to draw vector/bitmap graphics and texts.</li>
	<li>Call EndDraw to flush the drawing instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>A note about gradient brushes. Unlike WPF, in Direct2D, gradient brushes 
always use global coordinate system. So you have to do additional work to 
calculate the position of each gradient stop.</p>
<h2>Draw complex paths</h2>
<p>It is almost impossible to draw complex paths without first creating them in 
a graphic authoring tool. WPF allows you to draw paths in Expression Design (or 
Expression Blend directly if the path is not too complex), and then export to 
XAML. WPF can directly render XAML content as vector graphics. With Direct2D, 
you do not have the luxuriate to utilize XAML. Traditionally, programmers tend 
to use bitmaps extensively, and avoid vector graphics as much as possible. 
However, bitmaps have a lot of disadvantages, such as difficult to animate and 
losing quality during scaling. Nowadays with WPF, a lot of managed applications 
have begun to use more and more vector graphics. Our native applications must 
catch up with them. Also Direct2D is a vector graphic API. So it will be great 
if we can use Expression Studio, but output Direct2D code instead of XAML.</p>
<p>You can try to create a tool to perform the translation. This sample provides 
you with a general idea. XAML is xml, and there&#39;s a powerful tool in Windows 7 
(and can be downloaded separately in Vista) named PowerShell. PowerShell is 
capable of a lot of tasks, including parsing xml files. You can use the WPF 
powered GUI PowerShell ISE to authorize PowerShell scripts. Assume your path 
contains bezier segments only, you can use the following script to generate C++ 
code from XAML snip.</p>
<p>$invocation = (Get-Variable MyInvocation -Scope 0).Value<br />
$currentDir = Split-Path $invocation.InvocationName<br />
cd $currentDir<br />
$xmlData = [xml](Get-Content PlanetDownPathXaml.xml)<br />
$segments = $xmlData.PathFigure.SelectNodes(&quot;BezierSegment&quot;)<br />
$segments | ForEach-Object { &quot;pSink-&gt;AddBezier(<br />
D2D1::BezierSegment(<br />
D2D1::Point2F({0}),<br />
D2D1::Point2F({1}),<br />
D2D1::Point2F({2})<br />
));<br />
&quot; -f $_.GetAttribute(&quot;Point1&quot;), $_.GetAttribute(&quot;Point2&quot;), 
$_.GetAttribute(&quot;Point3&quot;) } &gt; PlanetDownPathOutput.txt</p>
<p>For more information about PowerShell, please refer to

<h2>Render transforms</h2>
<p>Unlike WPF, in Direct2D, there&#39;s no object tree. A 
transform is applied to the whole render target, which affects all pending 
drawing instructions, not to a particular object. So after you want to transform 
the planet using matrix a, and then want to transform the star with matrix b, 
you need to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Call SetTransform, passing matrix a as the parameter.</li>
	<li>Draw all elements containing in the planet. They will all use matrix a.</li>
	<li>Call SetTransform, passing matrix b as the parameter.</li>
	<li>Draw all elements containing in the star. They will all use matrix b.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to draw an untransformed element, please set the transform back 
to an identity matrix before drawing it.</p>
<h2>Hit test</h2>
<p>To handle mouse input, you handle the standard Win32 message loop. 
Input system is independent from rendering engines such as Direct2D.</p>
<p>To perform hit test, you call the FillContainsPoint function on the geometry 
(or StrokeContainsPoint if you only want to hit test the stroke). Note when 
drawing known geometries (such as ellipse), normally you do not need to create a 
geometry. However, if you want to perform hit test on the known gemetry, you 
have to explicitly create it.</p>
<p>Unlike WPF, with Direct2D&#39;s immediate rendering model, it does not retain a 
tree about each geometry&#39;s transform, so you must explicitly pass the transform 
matrix as a parameter in FillContainsPoint.</p>
<h2>Z-index</h2>
<p>Once again, in an immediate rendering envionment, you lose the track of 
previous rendered elements. It will be impossible to say, hey, the planet is 
rendered later than the star, but I hope the star will cover the planet. There&#39;s 
no concept of z-index in Direct2D. To simulate z-index, you will have to plan 
carefully on the order of the elements being rendered. For exmaple, if you hope 
the star to cover the planet, draw the planet first and then the star. On the 
othe hand, if you hope the planet to cover the star, draw the star first and 
then the planet.</p>
<h2>Clip path</h2>
<p>Direct2D doesn&#39;t support clipping path directly. However, a similar effect 
can be achieved by intersecting the geometry with the clipping path. To perform 
common geometry operations (such as intersect and union), you need to prepare 
the two source geometries first, and then call CombineWithGeometry on the first 
geometry, passing the second geometry as the parameter, and finally save the 
result to a third geometry. Please remember to delete the source geometries if 
you no longer need them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Windows 7 ships with a new vector graphic API: Direct2D. It primarily targets 
native developers. If you need to create a graphic rich application using native 
code, Direct2D is the best choice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you must note that the graphic API is just graphic API. It 
doesn&#39;t cover anything about application framework and UI framework. Application 
framework and UI framework in Windows 7 are largely not changed. For example, 
you can still use MFC as your application framework. Future versions of Windows 
may ship with new modern application frameworks. It may even allow you to use 
XAML in native applications! But that remains to see. For now, if 
you&#39;re just creating a business application or a utility with simple UI, you can 
still use the built-in system Controls. In Windows 7, system Controls are still 
rendered using GDI, because that&#39;s enough if you don&#39;t need to customize the 
appearance. Future versions of Windows may rewrite the system Controls using 
Direct2D. But that&#39;s still under discussion.</p>
