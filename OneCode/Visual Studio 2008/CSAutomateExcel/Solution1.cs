* Project:      CSAutomateExcel
* Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
* 
* Solution1.AutomateExcel demonstrates automating Microsoft Excel application by 
* using Microsoft Excel Primary Interop Assembly (PIA) and explicitly assigning 
* each COM accessor object to a new varaible that you would explicitly call 
* Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject to release it at the end. When you use this 
* solution, it is important to avoid calls that tunnel into the object model 
* because they will orphan Runtime Callable Wrapper (RCW) on the heap that you 
* will not be able to access in order to call Marshal.ReleaseComObject. You need 
* to be very careful. For example, 
* 
*   Excel.Workbook oWB = oXL.Workbooks.Add(missing);
* 
* Calling oXL.Workbooks.Add creates an RCW for the Workbooks object. If you 
* invoke these accessors via tunneling as this code does, the RCW for Workbooks 
* is created on the GC heap, but the reference is created under the hood on the 
* stack and are then discarded. As such, there is no way to call 
* MarshalFinalReleaseComObject on this RCW. To get such kind of RCWs released, 
* you would either need to force a garbage collection as soon as the calling 
* function is off the stack (see Solution2.AutomateExcel), or you would need to 
* explicitly assign each accessor object to a variable and free it.
* 
*   Excel.Workbooks oWBs = oXL.Workbooks;
*   Excel.Workbook oWB = oWBs.Add(missing);
