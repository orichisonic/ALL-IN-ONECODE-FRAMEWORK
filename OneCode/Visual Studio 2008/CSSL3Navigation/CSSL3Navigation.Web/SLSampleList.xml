    <Sample Name="CSSL3WriteableBitmap" Language="C#" Author="Yilun Luo" ScrImage="/Images/wb.jpg"
            Link="http://cfx.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx">
      <Description>        WriteableBitmap is a new feature in Silverlight 3. It allows you to work with
        raw pixel data of a bitmap image. This enables a lot of useful scenarios. This
        sample contains 3 sub samples which demonstrate some common tasks when
        working with WriteableBitmap:
        ·        The gun shoot sample. It allows you to select two images of different
        size, scales them to the same resolution, and puts one on top of the other.
        When you click the top image to fire some bullets, a gun mark will be
        created, and you'll be able to see through the bottom image. This sample
        demonstrates how to scale a source image to a specific resolution (800 * 600
        in this case), as well as how to modify individual pixels.
        ·        The fill color sample. It implements a common feature in painting
        programmers: Fill an area with a solid color. It demonstrates how to apply
        common algorithms to Silverlight WriteableBitmap, as well as how to avoid
        stack overflow in very deep recursive methods by simulating the way CLR
        invokes methods.
        ·        The screenshot sample. It demonstrates another feature of 	WriteableBitmap:
        Create bitmap screenshots from either bitmap or non-bitmap elements. It allows
        you to save the result to a bmp file. It also demonstrates the limitation of
        the screenshot feature.

      <Description>        This example demonstrates how to work with Style and ControlTemplate in
        Silverlight using XAML. While it is possible to create styles in code (but
        not possible to create ControlTemplates in code), it is generally
        discouraged. So there's no corresponding Style/ControlTemplate samples
        written in code.
        This sample targets solution developers who's focusing on code logic rather
        than providing wonderful user experience. We do not intend to provide samples
        targeting interactive developers. If you're an interactive developer, you can
        find samples and tutorials on our Expression Studio web site:
