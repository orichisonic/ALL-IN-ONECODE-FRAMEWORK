' The VBAutomateExcel example demonstrates how to use Visual Basic.NET code 
' to create a Microsoft Excel instance, create a workbook, fill data into a 
' specific range, save the workbook, close the Microsoft Excel application 
' and then clean up unmanaged COM resources.
' 
' Office automation is based on Component Object Model (COM). When you call a 
' COM object of Office from managed code, a Runtime Callable Wrapper (RCW) is 
' automatically created. The RCW marshals calls between the .NET application 
' and the COM object. The RCW keeps a reference count on the COM object. If 
' all references have not been released on the RCW, the COM object of Office 
' does not quit and may cause the Office application not to quit after your 
' automation. In order to make sure that the Office application quits cleanly, 
' the sample demonstrates two solutions.
' 
' Solution1.AutomateExcel demonstrates automating Microsoft Excel application 
' by using Microsoft Excel Primary Interop Assembly (PIA) and explicitly 
' assigning each COM accessor object to a new varaible that you would 
' explicitly call Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject to release it at the end. 
' 
' Solution2.AutomateExcel demonstrates automating Microsoft Excel application 
' by using Microsoft Excel PIA and forcing a garbage collection as soon as 
' the automation function is off the stack (at which point the RCW objects 
' are no longer rooted) to clean up RCWs and release COM objects.
