' Solution1.AutomateExcel demonstrates automating Microsoft Excel application by 
' using Microsoft Excel Primary Interop Assembly (PIA) and explicitly assigning 
' each COM accessor object to a new varaible that you would explicitly call 
' Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject to release it at the end. When you use this 
' solution, it is important to avoid calls that tunnel into the object model 
' because they will orphan Runtime Callable Wrapper (RCW) on the heap that you 
' will not be able to access in order to call Marshal.ReleaseComObject. You need 
' to be very careful. For example, 
' 
'   Dim oWB As Excel.Workbook = oXL.Workbooks.Add()
' 
' Calling oXL.Workbooks.Add creates an RCW for the Workbooks object. If you 
' invoke these accessors via tunneling as this code does, the RCW for Workbooks 
' is created on the GC heap, but the reference is created under the hood on the 
' stack and are then discarded. As such, there is no way to call 
' MarshalFinalReleaseComObject on this RCW. To get such kind of RCWs released, 
' you would either need to force a garbage collection as soon as the calling 
' function is off the stack (see Solution2.AutomateExcel), or you would need to 
' explicitly assign each accessor object to a variable and free it.
' 
'   Dim oWBs As Excel.Workbooks = oXL.Workbooks
'   Dim oWB As Excel.Workbook = oWBs.Add()
