' The VBAutomateWord example demonstrates the use of Visual Basic.NET codes 
' to create a Microsoft Word instance, create a new document, insert a 
' paragraph and a table, save the document, close the Microsoft Word 
' application and then clean up unmanaged COM resources.
' 
' Office automation is based on Component Object Model (COM). When you call a 
' COM object of Office from managed code, a Runtime Callable Wrapper (RCW) is 
' automatically created. The RCW marshals calls between the .NET application 
' and the COM object. The RCW keeps a reference count on the COM object. If 
' all references have not been released on the RCW, the COM object of Office 
' does not quit and may cause the Office application not to quit after your 
' automation. In order to make sure that the Office application quits cleanly, 
' the sample demonstrates two solutions.
' 
' Solution1.AutomateWord demonstrates automating Microsoft Word application by 
' using Microsoft Word Primary Interop Assembly (PIA) and explicitly assigning 
' each COM accessor object to a new varaible that you would explicitly call 
' Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject to release it at the end. 
' 
' Solution2.AutomateWord demonstrates automating Microsoft Word application by 
' using Microsoft Word PIA and forcing a garbage collection as soon as the 
' automation function is off the stack (at which point the RCW objects are no 
' longer rooted) to clean up RCWs and release COM objects.
