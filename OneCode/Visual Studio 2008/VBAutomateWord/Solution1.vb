' Solution1.AutomateWord demonstrates automating Microsoft Word application 
' by using Microsoft Word Primary Interop Assembly (PIA) and explicitly 
' assigning each COM accessor object to a new varaible that you would 
' explicitly call Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject to release it at the end. 
' When you use this solution, it is important to avoid calls that tunnel into 
' the object model because they will orphan Runtime Callable Wrapper (RCW) on 
' the heap that you will not be able to access in order to call 
' Marshal.ReleaseComObject. You need to be very careful. For example, 
' 
'   Dim oDoc As Word.Document = oWord.Documents.Add()
'  
' Calling oWord.Documents.Add creates an RCW for the Documents object. If you 
' invoke these accessors via tunneling as this code does, the RCW for 
' Documents is created on the GC heap, but the reference is created under the 
' hood on the stack and are then discarded. As such, there is no way to call 
' MarshalFinalReleaseComObject on this RCW. To get such kind of RCWs released, 
' you would either need to force a garbage collection as soon as the calling 
' function is off the stack (see Solution2.AutomateWord), or you would need 
' to explicitly assign each accessor object to a variable and free it.
' 
'   Dim oDocs As Word.Documents = oWord.Documents
'   Dim oDoc As Word.Document = oDocs.Add()
