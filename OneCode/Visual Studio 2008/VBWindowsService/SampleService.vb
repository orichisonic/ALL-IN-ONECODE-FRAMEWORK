' Provides a sample service class that derives from the service base class - 
' System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase. The sample service logs the service 
' start and stop information to the Application event log, and shows how to 
' run the main function of the service in a thread pool worker thread.

    ''' <summary>
    ''' The function is executed when a Start command is sent to the service
    ''' by the SCM or when the operating system starts (for a service that 
    ''' starts automatically). It specifies actions to take when the service 
    ''' starts. In this code sample, OnStart logs a service-start message to 
    ''' the Application log, and queues the main service function for 
    ''' execution in a thread pool worker thread.

    ''' <param name="args">Command line arguments</param>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' A service application is designed to be long running. Therefore, it 
    ''' usually polls or monitors something in the system. The monitoring is 
    ''' set up in the OnStart method. However, OnStart does not actually do 
    ''' the monitoring. The OnStart method must return to the operating 
    ''' system after the service's operation has begun. It must not loop 
    ''' forever or block. To set up a simple monitoring mechanism, one 
    ''' general solution is to create a timer in OnStart. The timer would 
    ''' then raise events in your code periodically, at which time your 
    ''' service could do its monitoring. The other solution is to spawn a 
    ''' new thread to perform the main service functions, which is 
    ''' demonstrated in this code sample.
    ''' </remarks>
