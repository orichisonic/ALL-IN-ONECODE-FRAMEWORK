' The ProjectInstaller component contains two installers by default.
' 
' * ServiceInstaller1 - installer for your service. The ServiceInstaller 
'   does work specific to the service with which it is associated. It is used 
'   by the installation utility to write registry values associated with the 
'   service to a subkey within the 
'   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services registry key. The 
'   service is identified by its ServiceName within this subkey. The subkey 
'   also includes the name of the executable or .dll to which the service 
'   belongs. If you have muliple services in one process, you should add 
'   multiple ServiceInstaller components to be associated with each service.
' 
' * ServiceProcessInstaller1 -  installer for the service's associated 
'   process. The ServiceProcessInstaller does work common to all services in 
'   an executable. It is used by the installation utility to write registry 
'   values associated with services you want to install.
' 
' You can register events (e.g. AfterInstall) of ServiceInstaller and 
' ServiceProcessInstaller components, and handle the events in 
' ProjectInstaller.cs.
