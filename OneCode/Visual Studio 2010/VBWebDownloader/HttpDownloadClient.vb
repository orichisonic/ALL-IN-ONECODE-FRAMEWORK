' This class is used to download files through internet.  It supplies public
' methods to Start, Pause, Resume and Cancel a download. 
' 
' When the download starts, it will check whether the destination file exists. If
' not, create a file with the same size as the file to be downloaded, then
' download the file in a background thread.
' 
' The downloaded data is stored in a MemoryStream first, and then written to local
' file.
' 
' It will fire a DownloadProgressChanged event when it has downloaded a
' specified size of data. It will also fire a DownloadCompleted event if the 
' download is completed or canceled.
' 
' The property DownloadedSize stores the size of downloaded data which will be 
' used to Resume the download.
' 
' The property StartPoint can be used in the multi-thread download scenario, and
' every thread starts to download a specific block of the whole file.
