' This class is used to download files through internet using multiple threads. 
' It supplies public  methods to Start, Pause, Resume and Cancel a download. 
' 
' Before the download starts, the remote server should be checked 
' whether it supports "Accept-Ranges" header.
' 
' When the download starts, it will check whether the destination file exists. If
' not, create a file with the same size as the file to be downloaded, then
' creates multiple HttpDownloadClients to download the file in background threads.
' 
' It will fire a DownloadProgressChanged event when it has downloaded a
' specified size of data. It will also fire a DownloadCompleted event if the 
' download is completed or canceled.
